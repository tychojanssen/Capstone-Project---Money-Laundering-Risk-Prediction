# Anti-Money Laundering Detection System
**Production-Ready AML Detection for Banking Compliance**

This project was originally developed in collaboration with Delphin Kaduli and Solomon Pinto.

**My contributions:**  
-**Conducted experiments on an undersampled dataset (1 million rows), increasing the fraud ratio from 0.01% to 3.5% to improve model training.
-**Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and quality.
-**Engineered 40 new features to enhance predictive performance.
-**Tested various techniques to handle data imbalance, including SMOTE at different fraud levels and class weighting.
-**Built and evaluated multiple models independently: logistic regression, tree-based models, neural networks, and ensemble methods.
-**Personally built, selected and finalized the best-performing model, which was used in the final project presentation.

## Project Overview
A machine learning-powered Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection system with an interactive Streamlit dashboard. Built using IBM's Synthetic AML Dataset (31.9M transactions), this system achieves **73% precision** and **ROC-AUC 97.8%**, making it production-ready for banking compliance teams.

##  Live Demo
 **[Visit Live Dashboard](https://cua-mda-aml-prediction.streamlit.app/)**

##  Key Features
- **Real-time Transaction Scoring**: Instant risk assessment for individual transactions
- **Calibrated Risk Scores**: Reliable probability estimates (when model says 10% risk, it means 10%)
- **Automatic Feature Engineering**: Extracts 20+ risk indicators from raw transaction data
- **Production-Optimized**: 27x reduction in false positives vs baseline models
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for compliance analysts

## Model Performance
- **Precision**: 72.75% (73% of alerts are true laundering cases)
- **Recall**: 18.87% (catches 1 in 5 laundering cases)
- **ROC-AUC**: 97.81% (excellent discrimination)
- **False Positive Rate**: 0.01% (only 752 false alarms out of 6.4M normal transactions)
- **Daily Alert Volume**: ~860 alerts (manageable workload)
